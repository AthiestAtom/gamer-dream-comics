    content: `Once upon a time, a saint was granted a wish about whatever his apprentices and their successors will be unique at shall get such type of power. After few centuries, people started forgetting about them and not recognizing their powers. In 21st century, a child with less physical potential but extra ordinary guts existed. His college life had just started. But neither was he rich in terms of friendship, nor in accounts. What he had were guts and loser gaming skills. Since he never had friends, he always gossiped with himself and called it fourth wall breaking. He too had a favorite teacher in his teenage. Not because that teacher was kind or friendly but due to hardworking and how strict to all the teacher was. That teacher wasn't aware of his own power to have profits ever in life decisions making. And similarly, his teacher, and teacher of teacher .... were given different powers which they all didn't use because they weren't aware of it. The kid with guts too got a peculiar kind of superpower. But powers could only be used in a very life-threatening situations which never came to any of the teacher's life.

An archaeologist was digging up all this history to find the truth of his thesis. A sacred book in hidden temple contained all its information, which he finally found. Now, he started linking the people who passed away weirdly and were extra ordinary. One after one, he got to know about this kid. But as soon as he could continue his research, some commandos with strange uniform took him in a portal where a man was waiting for him. The man was actually the variant of kid from an altered timeline who had same powers as original timeline kid. Using his powers, he built a city to rule upon, whose civilians were his slaves trapped in that location. But the archaeologist had a backup. He transferred all the research data in his latest invention of AI drone to search the kid and avoid kid's variant who was stronger. This variant was learning different techniques involved in enhancing his powers, when he used the serums that temporarily boosted them but decreased his permanent potential. Since then, the variant wanted to steal original one's powers and keep ruling his kingdom.

After escaping his dimension, drone started finding that kid. Finally, it somehow reached the kid which seemed to be a loser who was struggling and facing numerous challenges to live. But his hyperactivity disorder made him isolated. In order to wake the powers, the drone attacked the kid, but the kid survived without using them. Next time, kid got unconscious but still no powers seemed to come up. Drone now doubted if the kid was him or not. But actually, the inherited power was saving him from being noticed by his variant. As soon as he used any powers, the variant could sense it to track him. To save the kid, the drone confronted him. He understood the concept in a second but lacked confidence upon his potential. He had bigger potential examples to be chosen for the power. But the drone had no time to explain why he was more than any of those examples. So, it him to a nearby railway and asked to try out. To do this, he closed his eyes and laid down on the track. Unlike before, he experienced dream of playing Temple run this time. After he stood up from the dream, he saw that the train went through him and the drone couldn't remember if he even laid. The same also happened before when the drone tried awakening his powers. The effort he did in his dreams used to change the reality, lasting him alive. This all was strange and didn't make much of sense at that moment. By discussing different memories, they both came to know that his powers are playing videogames. Any suitable video game runs in his dream, where he wins and reality changes accordingly.

To understand this concept better, he chose some of his favorite emulator and pc games. Learning from craft mode in Minecraft, cheats in GTA vice city, passive abilities in Free Fire, he upgraded his skills more and more. But his variant sensed his training soon. So, he too worked on taming skills against his skills, like processor lagging against Minecraft, Claude/CJ from other GTA games and paid subscription in Free Fire. Now the variant was ready to steal powers of kid. He travelled to main timeline in that midnight while kid was sleeping and silently sat on a chair observing carefully the same face as him. The kid suddenly sensed someone 's presence near him and woke up. This made the variant say (Darr Gaya? Mujhe bada maza aata hai jab koi dar jata hai , pata chalta hai ki usse apni jaan ki fikar hai , aur jise jaan ki fikar ho, maa kasam maarne kaa mazaa ussi ko aata hai ) . Changing the expression to smirk, the kid mocked with (takkk..... Huhhhhhh....!!!!! ). Within a few seconds, the reality of room shed into a dark purple world, and everything faded including the drone. Both got engaged in first battle as Tekken 3 game where kid chooses Eddy Gordo, and Variant chooses Jin Kazama. After a tremendous fight, Jin Kazama turns into devil (accessing Tekken 5 options) and defeats the Eddy. Such upgrades were not accessible by kid yet. So, for next battle kid entered in Swordigo 's character and Variant entered in the character 's master whose soul had helped the character in game. This master was accessible of more than 6 kinds of energies, more than 10 lives, and more than 5 trinkets. Even if the kid had good skills in game, the dimension rift was not harming variant 's master due to one of the trinkets. The kid lost again.

Now to the final round, the kid chose to be the Ethan of Pokémon Crystal, and Variant chose to be Red. He defeated all the Pokémons of Ethan easily. But somehow the battle didn't end. Variant was furious about the rules of game, suddenly everything came back to starting where the Pokémons of Ethan had full stats and full HP and similarly with Red. The Variant realised that kid wasn't playing real Pokémon Crystal on GBC machine, but in emulator app on some other device, which has extra features of quick save and quick load. Now, the strategy to win wasn't by defeating all the Pokémons of Ethan, but to drain the kid's energy until kid feds up enough to not load again. The kid lost in that battle more than 100000 times, but didn't gave up, because he had learned not to fed up with any situation while catching one of the rarest Pokémons. While, the kid had enough guts to not fed up, the Variant was exhausted by making the same efforts and defeating all Pokémon again and again. He understood why he couldn't check his future in timeline, because quick save and quick load may never allow him to win. The variant not just accepted his defeat but also sacrificed in guilt to underestimate the real one. Although, people could never sense that someone protected them from whom and what abomination was about to occur. The kid then went back to his life. Drone too started to find other apprentices chosen by the powerful teachers.`,
